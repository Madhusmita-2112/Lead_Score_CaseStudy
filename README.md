# Lead_Score_CaseStudy
X Education, an online education company, seeks to boost its lead conversion rate by developing a logistic regression model. They aim to assign lead scores ranging from 0 to 100 to identify the most promising leads, known as "Hot Leads," who are likely to convert into paying customers. With a dataset of around 9,000 leads and various attributes like Lead Source and Total Visits, the model will be constructed. The deliverables include a well-commented Jupyter notebook presenting the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, a document will be provided, addressing potential future problems and their solutions based on the model. A visually appealing presentation summarizing the analysis approach, significant findings, and actionable recommendations will be prepared. Lastly, a concise 500-word summary report will outline the assignment's progression and key insights gained.
